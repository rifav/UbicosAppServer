<h1>Row Boat Lab</h1>

<p>

Is every equation dealing with constant speed proportional? Whose boat is going the fastest?

You will run the experiment two times. The first time, just push start and collect your data without making any changes.
The second time, you may click on the “Paddles” button and choose one variable to change. Then collect your data a second time.


On your whiteboard, include the question, table, graph, an equation for each line, how did changing the variable change the speed? How can you tell just by looking at the graph? At your equation? At your table?
