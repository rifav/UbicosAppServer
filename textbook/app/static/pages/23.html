    Think about the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Is speed a proportional relationship?</li>
        <li>Observe the moving object. What do you notice?</li>
        <li>What measurements should we take?</li>
        <li>What units will we use?</li>
        <li>Do we plan to collect more than one set of data?</li>
        <li>What procedures do we need to follow so that our data is as accurate and comparable as possible?</li>
    </ul>
