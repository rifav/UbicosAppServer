<h1>Discuss your Model</h1>

<p>

Look at other student's solutions in the Perfect Purple Paint Gallery (Gallery #1) and leave a comment on each picture.
    Ask a question, give a compliment, or explain what you are thinking. Be specific.
    <a href="#" class="activity-button individual" data-id="1" data-heading="Perfect Purple Paint Gallery"
               data-description="" > </a>
    <br/>

</p>

<p>
    Do you understand / agree with their solutions?

    <a href="#" class="activity-button self-gallery" data-id="1" data-heading="Perfect Purple Paint Gallery"
               data-description="" > </a>
</p>

<p>
    Once you have commented individually, move to the group discussion.
    With your classmates, discuss the similarities and differences between the way groups represented the relationship
    between the red and blue paint? Does the way the group represented it change the color of the paint?
    How did people represent their perfect purple paint? Do different peopleâ€™s representations mean the same thing? How are the representations (drawings, numbers, etc.) related?

    Then enter the gallery discussion section and discuss the discussion question with the others.
    <a class="activity-button gallery" data-description="Comment on the images as a group and help each other to understand math problem." data-heading="Perfect Purple Paint Gallery" data-id="1"
       href="#"> </a>

</p>

<p>
    Review the comments your group received in the whiteboard. [add option here]
    Is there anything you would change on your
    <a class="video" data-id="1" data-video-url="http://www.didax.com/apps/unifix/"> Whiteboard Tool</a>
    <a class="activity-button video" data-id="1" data-video-url="http://www.didax.com/apps/unifix/"></a>

    based on your classmates' feedback? What can you change to make your board more clear?

    If you do not yet have a rule on your board, do your best to add one. Think about how you would find the number of cups of each color needed for any size room.
