    Visit the Gallery of other groups to observe their paint splashes, tables, graphs, and rules. Leave a comment on each picture.
    Ask a question, give a compliment, or explain what you are thinking. Be specific. Do you have any questions about what you see?
    Is there any help you can give to the group? Anything you liked or thought was creative?
