<h1>Cobi Needs your help Again!</h1>


<p>
All week we have discussed how you explaining and discussing ideas with others not only helps them,
    but helps you understand the material better as well. Nowâ€™s your chance to practice your help-giving
    skills by teaching a computer agent how to solve ratio problems.


If you need a reminder of how Cobi works, watch the Cobi Training Video.


Use your assignment to help teach Cobi how to solve his problem.
