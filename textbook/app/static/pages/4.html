<h1>Create A Model: Part 1 </h1>

<p>

    I’ve found the perfect color to paint my house. It’s made by mixing two cups of blue paint with three cups of red paint. That makes one batch of <strong>
    Perfect Purple Paint</strong>.

    I know it will take at least 20 cups to paint my bathroom. I don’t want to make a bunch of small batches.

</p>

<p>
    Let’s make a model using the Unifix Cube blocks to represent the information in this problem. Have one color block represent red paint
    and another color block represent blue paint. Open the
    <a class="video" data-id="1" data-video-url="http://www.didax.com/apps/unifix/">Unifix Tool</a> and
    show how you could make 20 cups of purple paint using this tool.

    Take a screenshot of your work by holding both the Ctrl + Shift +
    <img src="/ss.png" alt="ss_icon" style="width: 10%; margin: 0px 10px -10px 10px"> button together in your Chromebook.

    Paste your Unifix screenshot on this
    <a class="whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url="">whiteboard</a> tool. As you make your whiteboard, think about these questions:
    <a class="activity-button whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url=""></a> <br/>

    <ul>
        <li>How do you know the color will be the same in the small batch as it is in the larger batch?</li>
        <li>Can you find multiple ways to model this relationship?</li>
        <li>Can you write a rule (using words or numbers) to create this color of paint that anyone could follow
        for any number of cups?</li>
        <li>Explain your thinking in words and draw arrows or labels to help others understand your thinking.</li>
