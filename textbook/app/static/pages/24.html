<h1>Buggy Lab Board Meeting</h1>



<p>
    Think back to the small group digital discussion you just had. Did someone make a particularly good point you want to share? Did someone have a great way of explaining that helped you understand? What did you discover from this activity?
    <br/>

    In the Board Meeting be prepared to discuss the following:
        <li> Is constant speed proportional?</li>
        <li> What are we looking for to see if this relationship is proportional?</li>
        <li> Why do we make graphs of data?</li>
        <li> Why do we write equations of lines?</li>
    <br/>
<p>
    Then, revisit the class definitions of Slope and Unit Rate in the Vocabulary page. [add vocab page]
    Finally, build on your model once again in the Model-So-Far page. [add model so far page]

    First, review these Talk Moves to help you make constructive comments.
Now, in the chat, Answer these two questions about x and y.
What does the x represent in your Buggy Lab graph?
What does the y represent in your graph?

Do you have any other questions about any of the activities we are doing? Let me know in the Chat!

Give any help to / share your thoughts with your classmates.
