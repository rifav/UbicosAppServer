<p>
    As a group, create a

    <a class="whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url="https://awwapp.com/#">whiteboard</a>
    <a class="activity-button whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url="https://awwapp.com/#"></a>
    with as many representations of the data as you can show. The whiteboard should include:
    <ul>
        <li> Data table  </li>
        <li> Graph with units and labels </li>
        <li> The story of the car. What did you observe? How did it move? How do you know? </li>
        <li> Is this a proportional relationship? Be prepared to defend your thinking! </li>
        <li> A rule in words and numbers that describes this relationship </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Remember: this is real data. Your measurements are not perfect.
    What rule works “best” or makes the most sense.

</p>

<p>
    Create a rule using words and an equation using the y = mx format. You can check your equation by entering it
    in the Equation tab of the graphing tool

    Take a screenshot of the whiteboard with your group’s data, and upload it to your
