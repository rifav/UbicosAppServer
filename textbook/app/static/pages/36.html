<p>
    Go back to the “Intro to Slope-Intercept Form” video from your Khan Academy Assignment.

    Did anyone respond to your post? What you think about their comments. Were the comments helpful?
    Did you understand the comment? Was there a better way to word the help?

    Make at least one comment (a complement or a suggestion) that builds on what someone else wrote.
