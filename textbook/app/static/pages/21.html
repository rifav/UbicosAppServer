<h2>Buggy Lab</h2>

<p>
    As a group, create a whiteboard with as many representations of the data as you can show.

    As a group, create a rule using words and an equation using the y = mx format. You can enter your equation in the Equation tab.

    It should include:
    Data table
    Graph with units and labels
    The story of the car. What did you observe? How did it move? How do you know?
    Is this a proportional relationship? Be prepared to defend your thinking!
    A rule in words and numbers that describes this relationship

    Remember: this is real data. Your measurements are not perfect. What rule works “best” or makes the most sense.

    Take a screenshot of the whiteboard with your group’s data, and upload it to your Buggy lab Gallery.
