<h1>Buggy Lab</h1>

<p>
    As a group, create a whiteboard with as many representations of the data as you can show.

    As a group, create a rule using words and an equation using the y = mx format. You can enter your equation in the Equation tab.

</p>
<p>
    The whiteboard should include:
    <li> Data table </li>
    <li> Graph with units and labels
    <li> The story of the car. What did you observe? How did it move? How do you know? </li>
    <li> Is this a proportional relationship? Be prepared to defend your thinking! </li>
    <li> A rule in words and numbers that describes this relationship </li>
</p>
<p>
    Remember: this is real data. Your measurements are not perfect. What rule works “best” or makes the most sense.
    <br/>
    Take a screenshot of the whiteboard with your group’s data, and upload it to your Buggy lab Gallery.
