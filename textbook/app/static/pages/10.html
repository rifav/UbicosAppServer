<h1>Cobi Needs your help!</h1>

<p>
    All week we have discussed how you explaining and discussing ideas with others not only helps them,
    but helps you understand the material better as well. Now’s your chance to practice your help-giving skills by teaching
    the computer agent, Cobi how to solve ratio problems.
