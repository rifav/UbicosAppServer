<h1>Apply your Model</h1>

<p>
    I love this color so much, I might use it for other rooms in my house, but I’m not sure yet exactly how many cups I’ll need.
    In your group, use the  <a class="video" data-id="1" data-video-url="http://www.didax.com/apps/unifix/">Unifix Tool</a>
    blocks to create as many models as you can. What are examples of how I could apply this color to any room in my house?
    <a class="activity-button video" data-id="1" data-video-url="http://www.didax.com/apps/unifix/"></a>
</p>

<p>
    Brainstorm your examples on a <a class="whiteboard" data-id="2" data-video-url="">whiteboard</a>.
    <a class="activity-button whiteboard" data-id="2" data-video-url=""></a> <br/>
    Then, add a table to your whiteboard to show possible quantities that would create the same color of purple paint.
    <ul>
        <li>
            How many cups of red and blue paint would I need if it took 100 cups to paint the whole house? 275 cups?
            Just one cup to paint a doll house?
        </li>
        <li>
            If I want to scale up and use the Perfect Purple Paint on my whole house, I’m not sure I want to do a physical
            model with blocks for numbers that big. Write a rule we could use to help us find how much paint would be needed without having to make a physical model.

    </ul>
