<h1>Discuss your Model</h1>

<p>

    Look at other student's solutions in the
    <a href="#" class="individual" data-id="1" data-heading="Perfect Purple Paint Gallery"
               data-description="" >Perfect Purple Paint Gallery</a> and leave a comment on each picture.
    Ask a question, give a compliment, or explain what you are thinking. Be specific. Do you understand/agree with their solutions?

               data-description="" > </a>
    <br/>

<p>
    Once you have commented individually, move to the
    <a class="gallery" data-description="Discuss the similarities and differences between the way groups represented the relationship between the red and blue paint."
       data-heading="Perfect Purple Paint Gallery" data-id="1"
       href="#">group discussion</a>.
    <a class="activity-button gallery" data-description="Discuss the similarities and differences between the way groups represented the relationship between the red and blue paint." data-heading="Perfect Purple Paint Gallery" data-id="1"
       href="#"> </a>
    With your classmates,
    <ul>
        <li>Discuss the similarities and differences between the way groups represented the relationship between the red and blue paint.</li>
        <li>Does the way the group represented it change the color of the paint?</li>
        <li>How did people represent their perfect purple paint? Do different peopleâ€™s representations
            mean the same thing? How are the representations (drawings, numbers, etc.) related?</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<!--<p>-->
<!--    Then enter the <a class="gallery" data-description="Discuss the similarities and differences between the way groups represented the relationship between the red and blue paint."-->
<!--       data-heading="Perfect Purple Paint Gallery" data-id="1" href="#">gallery discussion</a> and discuss the discussion question with the others.-->

    <a class="self-gallery" data-description="" data-heading="Perfect Purple Paint Gallery" data-id="1" href="#">Review the comments</a>
    your group received in the whiteboard.
    <a class="activity-button self-gallery" data-description="" data-heading="Perfect Purple Paint Gallery" data-id="1" href="#"> </a>

    <ul>
        <li>Is there anything you would change on your <a class="whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url="https://awwapp.com/#">whiteboard</a>
<!--    <a class="activity-button whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url="https://awwapp.com/#"></a>-->
    based on your classmates' feedback?</li>
        <li>What can you change to make your board more clear?</li>
    </ul>
     If you do not yet have a rule on your board, do your best to add one. Think about how you would find the number of cups of each color needed for any size room.
