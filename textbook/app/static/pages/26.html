    Go into the

    Make sure to think about how they have presented their information. You can also make comments about the following:
    Every point on this line represents a ratio. What is the rate of change for the graph? What is a rule (equation) you can use to describe any point on this line?
    What does a rate of change on a graph mean? What does it mean specifically for this graph? What did we discover?

    Is constant speed proportional? Explain your thinking. Do you agree with each boardâ€™s rationale?
    Go back and look at the comments on your own
