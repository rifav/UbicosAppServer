    Go into the Gallery and look at the whiteboards of the other groups.

    Make sure to think about how they have presented their information. You can also make comments about the following:
    Every point on this line represents a ratio. What is the rate of change for the graph? What is a rule (equation) you can use to describe any point on this line?
    What does a rate of change on a graph mean? What does it mean specifically for this graph? What did we discover?

    Is constant speed proportional? Explain your thinking. Do you agree with each board’s rationale?
    Go back and look at the comments on your own <a class="whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url="https://awwapp.com/#">whiteboard</a>.
