<h1>Cobi Needs your help Again!</h1>


<p>
    All week we have discussed how you explaining and discussing ideas with others not only helps them,
    but helps you understand the material better as well. Now’s your chance to practice your help-giving
    skills by teaching a computer agent how to solve ratio problems.


    If you need a reminder of how Cobi works, watch the Cobi Training Video [add the link]


    Use your assignment [xx from assignment folder] to help teach Cobi how to solve the problems.
