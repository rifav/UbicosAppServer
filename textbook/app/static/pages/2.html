<h1>Create A Model</h1>

<p>

    I’ve found the perfect color to paint my house. It’s made by mixing two cups of blue paint with three cups of red paint. That makes one batch of Perfect Purple Paint.

    I know it will take at least 20 cups to paint my bathroom. I don’t want to make a bunch of small batches.


    Let’s make a model using blocks to represent the information in this problem. Have one color block represent red paint and another color block represent blue paint.

    Show how you could make 20 cups of purple paint using the Unifix tool?

    Open

    <a class="activity-button video" data-id="1" data-video-url="http://www.didax.com/apps/unifix/"></a>
    Take a screenshot (ctrl + [add image])
    <br/>

</p>

<p>
    Paste your Unifix screenshot on the whiteboard [add aww whiteboard link here]. <br/>

    As you make your whiteboard, think about these questions:
    <b>How do you know the color will be the same in the small batch as it is in the larger batch? </b>
    Can you find multiple ways to model this relationship? Can you write a rule (using words or numbers) to create this color of paint that anyone could follow
    for any number of cups? Explain your thinking in words and draw arrows or labels to help others understand your thinking.

Take a screenshot of your whiteboard solution and upload the screenshot in the Perfect Purple Paint Gallery #1.
